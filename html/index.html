<script type="module" src="./application.js"></script>
    <p>This graph has a hierarchical grouping defined over the nodes.  We generate constraints to keep the bounding boxes of
        disjoint groups from overlapping and to keep nested groups fully contained within their parents' bounding boxes.
    Try dragging the nodes so that they bump into other nodes and groups.
